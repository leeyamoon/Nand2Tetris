                           Project 11 - Compilation, Continued
                           -----------------------------------

## Submitted Files
- README: This file.
- JackCompiler: The executable.
- Makefile: A makefile for the project.
- JackCompiler.py: The main .py file for the project.
- JackTokenizer.py: Tokenizes an input .jack file according to Jack's grammar, The same one from project 10.
- CompilationEngine.py: Gets input from a JackTokenizer and emits its parsed 
  structure into an output stream.
- VMWriter.py: Writes VM commands into a file. Encapsulates VM command syntax.
- SymbolTable.py: Associates names with information needed for Jack compilation.

## Remarks
* we added 3 main functions to the tokenizer
* the first function is create_processed_tokens which calls other smaller functions each does a different part of cleaning the file and creating the tokens
* the second function is get_cur_token which returns the value of the current token
* the third function is get_next_token is a function that returns the value of the upcoming token, this function comes in handy when compiling in the CompilationEngine
* we added to the CompilationEngine a function
* the function is compile_subroutine_body which compiles a subroutine body statement 
- Your tar should only include a run-script named 'JackCompiler', a Makefile 
called "Makefile", a README, and the source code for your implementation.
- You can change the template however you want, or even not use it at all. But,
  your project should use the same standard installation and running procedures,
  and standard inputs that the template uses. 
- The README file must contain the following:
	- In the first line: login(s) of the author(s), 
	separated by commas and nothing else! 
	If you work alone, do not include a comma. 
	Logins should be identical to the names of your home folders and are 
	case-sensitive.
	- Name(s), email(s) and ID(s) of the project's author(s).
	- Any remarks you have about your submission.
